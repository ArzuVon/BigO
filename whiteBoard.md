## Advice from David Souther

## Understands the technical problem

> The top row of boxes is about understanding the question being asked. This begins with the problem statement from the interviewer, and ends with identifying a “small, interesting” test case. Along the way they should have defined any unknown terms in the prompt, and declared a method signature for the function they’ll implement. This should not take more than five minutes.

## 1. Asked meaningful clarifying questions

- Wrote down the problem statement
- Asked clarifying questions
- Recorded answers

## 2. Identified input and output types

- Showed one example and confirmed types
- Presented method/function signature

## 3. Presented test case values

- Asked for given example
- Provided additional example
- Iterated to smallest interesting test case

## 4. Presented atypical test case values

- Creates empty example
- Creates false, “negative”, or “edge case” test case

## 5. Solved the technical problem

- Visually illustrated the algorithm
- Drew a diagram of the input
- Drew a diagram of the output
- Drew a diagram of the steps in the middle

## 6. Identified a working algorithm

- Identified an appropriate traversal or iteration to convert the input the output
- Identified intermediate data structures and their applications to the problem
- Identified an appropriate operations during iteration

## 7. Presents a working solution

- Code was correct
- Code was idiomatic
- Code solves the problem and is bug free
- Code has few or no syntactic errors

## 8. Code was idiomatic

- Used built in data structures and algorithms as appropriate
- Code avoids magic constants, needless repetition, and other anti-patterns

## 9. Verified a working solution

- Stepped through their solution
- Big O time and space are analyzed- Verbally describe change of state for variables using a specific input
- Visually traces change of state of variables for specific inputs

## 10. Big O time and space are analyzed

- Justified a Big O time and space complexity

> he interviewee justified the time and space complexity, probably using a common O(1), O(logN), O(NlogN), or O(N2). There was an understanding that time complexity increases with nested iteration, and space complexity increases with memory (or variable) allocations
> Time and space complexity was correct
> The justification was correct for their algorithm
> Did not miss implications of using language builtins
> The interviewee identified any time and space implications from their language built-ins, and identified them correctly

## 11. Communicated effectively throughout

- Verbalized their thought process
- Provided rationale when choosing between approaches
- Answered specific questions along the way
- Provided correct definitions for data structures
- Professionalism and Competencies
- Followed an organized process

## 12. Professionalism and Competencies

- Growth Mindset - reflects on challenges as they arise; neither over nor under confident when receiving feedback

## 13. Followed an organized process

- Half a point for each box in order
- Half a point for finishing 7th box in under 45 minutes
