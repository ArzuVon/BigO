      - Problem Statement
         - Approach 1:
            - Create a new array.
            - Traverse the first array by outer loop and second array by inner loop.
            - In the inner loop, Concatenate the first array element with the second array element and push it in a new array.
        - Approach 2:
          - Create a new array.
          - The same approach is followed here, for every element of the first array, every element of the second array is concatenated and pushed to the new array with the help of .apply() and .map() method.
