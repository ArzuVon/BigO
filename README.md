### Algorithm

- A set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem

- An algortithm should have inputs and outputs

- Each step should be clear and unambiguous

- Language independent(code in any language)

- World Example: Recipes to make food

- Computer Example:

  - Algorithm to add two numbers:

    - Two numbers 'a' and 'b'

    - Add numbers using '+'

    - return the value

    - Sum of 'a' and 'b'

### Measuring performance

`The absolute running time of an algorithm cannot be predicted, since it depends on a number of factors`

- Programming language used to implement the algortithm

- The computer the program runs on

- Other programs running at the same time

- Qality of the operating system
